## Description:
The goal of this project is to explore the concept of bias through data on Wikipedia articles - specifically, articles on political figures from a variety of countries. For this project, we will combine a dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of country populations, and use a machine learning service called ORES to estimate the quality of each article.


## Data Source:
1. The Wikipedia politicians by country dataset can be found on Figshare. Read through the documentation for this repository, then download and unzip it to extract the data file, which is called page_data.csv.

2. The population data is available in CSV format as WPDS_2020_data.csv. This dataset is drawn from the world population data sheet published by the Population Reference Bureau.
